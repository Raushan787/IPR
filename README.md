Created the Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) for a saturated oil reservoir using the Fetkovich equation,  
I also developed IPR curves for gas reservoirs, 
which helped analyze how the reservoir behaves under different pressure conditions.looking at both current and future production scenarios.
